Clojure Resources
=================

This is a compilation of resources about software development in Clojure(Script).
I maintain this page as a personal reference of interesting Clojure related information but also to provide this information to other (beginning) Clojurists.


* [Clojure(Script) Development](https://github.com/lsolbach/ClojureResources/blob/master/ClojureDevelopment.md) - List of resources, libraries, tuturials and videos for Clojure(Script)
* [Clojure Presentation](https://github.com/lsolbach/ClojureResources/blob/master/presentation/clojure_presentation.md) - An interactive Clojure presentation
* [deps.edn](https://github.com/lsolbach/ClojureResources/blob/master/deps.edn)
